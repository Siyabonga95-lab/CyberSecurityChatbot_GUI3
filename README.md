###  Install SQLite NuGet Package
1. Open your project in Visual Studio
2. Go to: **Tools → NuGet Package Manager → Manage NuGet Packages for Solution**
3. Click the **Browse** tab
4. Search: `System.Data.SQLite`
5. Select it → click **Install**
6. Click **OK** on any popup

### Step 2 — Add New Class Files
Right-click your project in Solution Explorer → **Add → New Item → Class**
Add these files (paste the code from each file provided):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `TaskItem.cs` | Data model for a task |
| `DatabaseManager.cs` | SQLite CRUD operations |
| `ActivityLogger.cs` | Records chatbot actions |
| `QuizManager.cs` | Quiz questions and scoring |
| `NLPProcessor.cs` | Natural language intent detection |

### Step 3 — Replace Existing Files
Replace the content of these existing files:
- `Chatbot.cs` → with the new enhanced version
- `MainWindow.xaml` → with the new version (has sidebar)
- `MainWindow.xaml.cs` → with the new version

### Step 4 — Keep These Files Unchanged
- `User.cs` — unchanged from Part 2 (or use the new copy provided)
- `App.xaml` and `App.xaml.cs` — do NOT touch these

### Step 5 — Build and Run
Press **F5** or **Ctrl+F5** to run.
The SQLite database file (`cybertasks.db`) is created automatically next to the .exe.

## HOW TO USE

### Task Assistant (Task 1 — 30 marks)
| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `add task Enable two-factor authentication` | Adds a new task |
| `add a task to review my privacy settings` | Natural language task add |
| `remind me to update my password` | Also adds a task |
| `show tasks` | Lists all tasks |
| `complete task 1` | Marks task ID 1 as done |
| `delete task 2` | Deletes task ID 2 |
| Click ** Add Task** sidebar button | Prompts you to type the task name |

### Quiz 
| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `start quiz` | Begins the 12-question quiz |
| Click ** Start Quiz** | Same as above |
| Type `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `True`, or `False` | Answers a question |

### Activity Log 
| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `show activity log` | Shows last 10 actions |
| `what have you done` | Same as above |
| `show full log` | Shows all recorded actions |
| Click ** Activity Log** | Same as above |

### NLP 
The chatbot understands natural variations:
- "Can you remind me to update my password?" → creates a task
- "I need to set up two factor auth" → creates a task
- "set a reminder for checking privacy settings" → creates a reminder
- "quiz me" / "test me" / "trivia" → starts the quiz

-  Sentiment detection (worried, curious, frustrated, happy, tired)
-  Spinner animation + typing effect

---

## DATABASE

The SQLite database file `cybertasks.db` is created automatically in the same folder as the running executable. It contains one table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Tasks (
    Id          INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    Title       TEXT    NOT NULL,
    Description TEXT    NOT NULL,
    Reminder    TEXT    DEFAULT '',
    IsCompleted INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    CreatedAt   TEXT    NOT NULL
);
```

CRUD operations covered (for full database marks):
- **CREATE** — `AddTask()`
- **READ**   — `GetAllTasks()`
- **UPDATE** — `MarkTaskComplete()`, `UpdateReminder()`
- **DELETE** — `DeleteTask()`
